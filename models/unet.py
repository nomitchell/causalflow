# models/unet.py
# PURPOSE: This file defines the core generative model of our framework. It's a U-Net
# architecture that learns the "velocity field" of the flow, predicting how an
# interpolated image `x_t` should move to become the clean image.
#
# WHERE TO GET CODE: The entire base U-Net (ResBlock, Attention, etc.) can be
# copied directly from the FlowPure repository. The key modification is adding the
# conditioning mechanism from CausalDiff.

        # The CausalDiff paper injects S as a bias and Z as a scale. This is a
        # specific architectural choice based on their causal hypothesis.
        #
        # TO-DO:
        # 1. Implement this exact mechanism first.
        # 2. EXPERIMENT: Is this the optimal way to condition a FLOW model?
        #    Alternative ideas to test later:
        #    - Concatenating s and z with the time embedding.
        #    - Using cross-attention between the image features and the latent factors.
        #    - Exploring different projection heads.
        #
        # This is not a copy-paste task; it requires thoughtful integration into the
        # U-Net's forward pass.

        # s: label-causative factor [batch, s_dim] (can be None for unconditional generation)
        # z: label-non-causative factor [batch, z_dim] (can be None)

        # TO-DO: Implement the forward pass of the U-Net. For each block,
        # you need to decide where and how to apply the s_bias and z_scale.
        #
        # Example for one block:
        # h = self.some_res_block(x)
        # if s is not None and z is not None:
        #     s_bias = self.s_proj(s).unsqueeze(-1).unsqueeze(-1)
        #     z_scale = self.z_proj(z).unsqueeze(-1).unsqueeze(-1)
        #     h = h * z_scale + s_bias # Apply the causal conditioning
