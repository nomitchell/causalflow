# (potentially adversarial) image at test time. This is where the model's

    # iterative optimization process that finds a clean image `x*` that is close
    # to the adversarial input but has a high likelihood under the generative model.
    #
    # TO-DO:
    # 1. Implement LM for a flow-based model. This is non-trivial. It involves
    #    calculating the gradient of the log-likelihood with respect to the input `x`
    #    and performing gradient ascent.
    # 2. As a simpler placeholder/baseline, one could run the reverse ODE/SDE of the
    #    flow from t=1 to t=0, starting from the adversarial image. This is what
    #    FlowPure does, but it may be less effective than true LM.
